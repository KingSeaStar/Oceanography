# Underwater Glider Survey - Amelia 2016 Wilmington Canyon Survey

Scripts, tools, data sources for analyzing and visualizing ocean data from:

- Slocum underwater gliders. (underwater temperature, conductivity, pressure, dissolved oxygen, optical properties etc.)
- Marine buoys (winds)
- Moorings and vertical profilers
- Satellites (sea surface temperature, sea surface height)
- Ocean models (most oceanographic parameters)
- Atmospheric models (winds)

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts I have written in my graduate school research (M.S. & Ph.D.).
I plan to translate some of the scripts from MATLAB to Phython.
I have learned from or directly used the scripts written by others in the oceanography community, meteology community, earth science community, and on the internet. 
Bugs might exist in some of the scripts.
