# Oceanography
Scripts, tools, data sources for analyzing and visualizing ocean data from:

- Slocum underwater gliders. (underwater temperature, conductivity, pressure, dissolved oxygen, optical properties etc.)
- Marine buoys (winds)
- Moorings and vertical profilers
- Satellites (sea surface temperature, sea surface height)
- Ocean models (most oceanographic parameters)
- Atmospheric models (winds)
